<div><p>Get started with NodeJS on Mac OSX</p>
<p>I had an old installation of node.js but got all kinds of erros. I tried to download a new version from <a href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a> but it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Then I tested with brew and that did seam to work. I did some cleaning up before I started.</p>
<pre><code># Remove global modules
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules

# Remove local modules
rm -rf ~/node_modules

# Saw a tip that making /usr/local mine makes this easier (not having to sudo all the time)
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local</code></pre>
<p>Then I installed nodejs with brew</p>
<pre><code>brew install nodejs

# There were som old files that needed cleaning
brew link node

# Delete what brew complains about and run again until it&#39;s done

# Run the npm (node package manager) installation
wget http://npmjs.org/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh 
./install.sh</code></pre>
<p>npm has global and local modules. I decided to only use global (to avoid the confusion not remebering where things were installed)</p>
<pre><code>npm config ls -l
npm config set global true</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: I&#39;ve learned that this isn&#39;t such a good idea when developing node applications of your own...</p>
<p>Try to do an update, make sure there are no erros</p>
<pre><code>npm update</code></pre>
<p>Set NODE_PATH so that require finds the installed modules:</p>
<pre><code>cd &amp;&amp; nano .bash_profile
export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules:~/node_modules:.</code></pre>
