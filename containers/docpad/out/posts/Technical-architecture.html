<p>These pages describes an outdated architecture for Gizur OM. These pages are kept for reference.</p>
<h1>Technical Architecture</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Server farm</h3>
<p>The architecture is built around three layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>A load balancer</li>
<li>Application server cluster - running apache and PHP where scaling is performed by automatically launching and terminating new instances</li>
<li>Database server cluster - a Master/Slave cluster running MySQL</li>
</ol>
<p>These servers make up a server farm.</p>
<h3>Environments</h3>
<p>vTiger environments are created in the server farm. For each environment is a MySQL user and database created in the MySQL server. Each environment also has a separate vTiger installation on the application server cluster.</p>
<p>There is a set of vTiger environments used for development, test and production:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sandbox environment - used for &quot;playing around&quot;. This environment is &quot;reset&quot; when needed</li>
<li>Development environment - used for development and unit testing of new functionality</li>
<li>Test environment - used for system and acceptance testing</li>
<li>Production environment - each client has a separate environment</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible to create temporary environments (vTiger installation + MySQL database) by copying an existing environment. </p>
