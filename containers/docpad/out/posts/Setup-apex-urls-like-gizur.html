<div><p>DNS configuration for apex url is not as simple as one might expect...</p>
<p>A CNAME can&#39;t be setup in the DNS for an apex url like gizur.com, only A record can be used.</p>
<p>CloudFront and Route 53 do not support apex urls at the moment. There is some support for Route 53 and ELB though.

<p><a href="http://wwwizer.com/">http://wwwizer.com/</a> can be used though, just setup an A record pointing to 174.129.25.170. Not sure how well this scales but it should work small scale.</p>
