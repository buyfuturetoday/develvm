<p>AWS Pipiline seams to be a nice tool coming up. It is currently only available in US regions but I&#39;m sure it will come in more regions.
One thing I don&#39;t see that it does handle thputh is copying data between buckets in different accounts. There is a Hadoop that handles
this, s3distcp.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll give this tool a go.</p>
<p>After checking the documentation I realized that  this tool only can work within one account. This is not what I need so I guess I&#39;ll have
to write a small script myself.</p>
