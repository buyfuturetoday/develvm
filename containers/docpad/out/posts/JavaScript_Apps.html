<p>JavaScript Apps</p>
<h1>=============</h1>
<p>HTML and JavaScript has matured and are quickly becoming a common platform development of large scale applications, often using REST services on the server.</p>
<p>Here I&#39;ll take a deep dive into to details of JavaScript. You&#39;ll see that JavaScript actually has very little in common with Java other than the syntax being  C-like. JavaScript is protoype based object oriented language similar to Scheme and is well suited for so called functional programming. <em>This means that it does take some effort to understand the quirks of the language and the libraries often used together with it</em>.</p>
<p>Browsers, the new operating systems, are also all but easy to work with, often behaving differently and oriented around a complex Document Object Model Tree (DOM Tree).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is possible to develop solid, large scale applications if you have a sound development methodology and take care to write code that is compatible cross browsers. There are also libraries, such as jQuery, that are of great help.</p>
<p>At least four things are needed when developing web applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>A methdology for unit testing and logging </li>
<li>A modular design</li>
<li>Event handling and routing between different parts of the application</li>
<li>Separation of data, presentation and logic - typically som MVC framework</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#39;ll take a look at these things going forward:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="JavaScript_Unit_Testing_and_Logging">JavaScript Unit Testing and Logging</a> - based on John Resig&#39;s Ninja book</li>
<li><a href="JavaScript_Modules">JavaScript Modules</a> - based on David Flannagan&#39;s book</li>
<li><a href="JavaScript_Routing">JavaScript Routing</a> - taking a look at crossroads.js and Hasher</li>
<li><a href="JavaScript_MVC_Framework">JavaScript MVC frameworks</a> - taking a look at backbone.js</li>
</ol>
<h2>UI Framework</h2>
<p>The framework used by twitter, boostrap, is open source and available for everyone to use. This framework manages rendering mobiles, tablets and web browsers. See the Boostrap-Example files here:</p>
