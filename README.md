Development virtual machine
---------------------------

This is a vm that I've configured with vagrant for misc development purposes.

To create and start a virtual machine, just do:

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# This folder is synced to the vm
ls /vagrant
```

Stop the virtual machine:

```
vagrant halt
```

Remove the virtual machine:

```
vagrant destroy
```
