## Support

Are you about to use (or are already using) one of our projects and need timely responses to your questions? Then priority support is for you. We'll guarantee same day responses, allowing your team to prioritise their efforts efficiently.

We'll hook you up with a customisable amount of support hours to be used each month. Unused hours are not carried over to the next month. If all the hours are used, you will be notified and have the ability to purchase more hours if you wish. Hours do not include development efforts, however when such efforts are required we will provide you with the necessary recommendations about how to proceed, the estimated costs, and proposed timeframe so you can know where everything stands.



## Development

Are you about to use (or are already using) one of our projects and would like pre-trained developers at your disposal for customising functionality, performing implementations, and acting on support development recommendations in a timely fashion? Then our development services are for you.

We'll hook you up with a customisable amount of development hours to be used each month. Unused hours are not carried over to the next month. Before embarking on a task, we'll let you know of the estimated hours the task will take and its proposed timeframe so you can always make the right decision about whether to go ahead on a particular task or not. If all the hours get used up, we'll let you know, halt work, and wait for your recommendation. You can leave it there, or purchase additional hours for that month.


## Advisory

Are you about embarking into unfamiliar territory and would like essential advice on how to go best about approaching certain problems or what technologies would be best catered for the particular situation? Then our advisory meetings are for you.

We'll hook you up with meeting at a requested time by you, where you can let us know the situation, the issues your facing, the concerns and questions you have, and we'll make the needed suggestions to lead you down the right path for a successful outcome. We can do the meetings either via phone, Skype, or Google Hangouts.


## Trainings

Are you wanting to learn a new technology, way of doing things, for yourself or for your team? Then our training services are for you.

For individuals, we provide workshop trainings (these are listed with the navigation on the left), online trainings (under development), and mentorship programs (upon request).

For companies, we can come in and train your people in a pre-defined format or in a custom format specified by you.
